# GAN-PROJECT
This repository contains the code and results for our study on the potential impact of large-scale generative models on future datasets. We investigated three key tasks—image classification, image generation, and image captioning—to analyze how the inclusion of AI-generated data affects downstream performance and model integrity over time.
